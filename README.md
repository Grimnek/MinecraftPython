# MinecraftPython

Minecraft in Python, as well as an improved version of two repositories:

https://github.com/clear-code-projects/Minecraft-in-Python/blob/main/UrsaCraft_video.py

https://github.com/kairess/minecraft-clone

Music: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ47H84Bc_Q&ab_channel=InfernalEntertain

Library documentation: https://www.ursinaengine.org/documentation.html

P.S. music.wav did not fit in the repository, so it is included in music.rar
